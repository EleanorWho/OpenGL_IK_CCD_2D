# OpenGL_IK_CCD_2D
Trinity College Dublin, Real-time Animation Assignment - CCD algorithm for 2D inverse kinematics. 


The algorithm can work well in more bone situations and also in 3D dimensions. You can add more bones by defining the bones with exact positions and adding them to the chain. The comments in the main.cpp show how to do this.


The difference between 2D project and 3D project is described in the 3D project repository.
